				<h3>Kiemo Galerija</h3>
				<p>Is an open gallery yard in Kaunas. The professor told us that it used to be a jew yard. There are a lot of art
				objects that you can photo. To be honest I truly wish that I had more time to explore it
				as you can wonder in it at lest for half an hour.</p>

				<h3>Klaipeda's port</h3>
				<p>The location from which you will buy tickets to the sea museum. It is just a beatiful place to relax. There is a statue of the girl, who is waiting for the ship. I could say
				that port is "must see" as Klaipeda is a sea city. It is the final destination if you go in Klaipeda among the central river. It is not far from the center
				and it is a perfect place to meet sunsets.</p>

				<h3>Jew's graffity</h3>
				<p>Firstly I thought that it is just painting of a random people. Then my professor told me
				that actualy they are graffity of jews that are used to either work or live in this buildings. 
				This is the way of Lithuanians honouring the victims of WW2. This fact seemed interesting for me so next time
				when you will see painting on walls of Kaunas or Vilnius you will know what they mean.</p>

				<h3>Uzupis</h3>
				<p>It is not just an art street in Vilnius. It is a republic with its own rules, where
				your palm is your passport. "Uzupis" can be translatted as "Over the river" and it is the other side of the bridge
				with a guard mermaid and barlament. Fun fact you can get a stamp of Uzupis in your real passport. 
				Also there are a lot of coffee shops and art installations. The pride of Uzupis is its own
				constitution that it is written in several languages.</p>

				<h3>Beaches</h3>
				<p>As you can observe I am not really a beach person, but my family enjoyed Palanga's beaches a lot. 
				I can say that Palanga's beaches more relaxing than Klaipeda ones. It a different atmosphere. Some people said
				that best beaches in Lithuania is on spit. To be honest, I never tried, so I will recommend Palanga. Seagules there are great!</p>

				<h3>Klaipeda's cats</h3>
				<p> After a year of living in Klaipeda this cat is remaining the biggest mystery for me. You can see him in all around Klaipeda with different texts. One 
				version stands that it is an art project of german painter and that these cats symbolize german legacy of Klaipeda (as Klaipeda
				is used to be a German city named Memel). Another version is simplier and stands tha it is just Lithuanian painter and he 
				just enjoy leaving his signs around the city. But the German version sounds way cooler!</p>
