				<h3>Coffee king</h3>
				<p>
					 It's a coffee shop in the center of Klaipeda. The thing I really like this place is
					its' cosy interior and original drinks. A lot of coffee options have ice cream, cream on top and
					even there are some alcopholic options there. Cherry on top is that their teas are named after great singers. 
					All cakes go with caramel syrop.
					Great minus is that it is a little pricey and you could not go often there. 
					Drink recommendation: "Princesės užgaida".

				<h3>Caffeine</h3>
				<p>
					 It's a coffee chain all around Lithuania. I could say the most popular one. From benefits
					 I could say that there are a lot of seasonal options. For example, pumpkin spice latte in autumn. I just 
					 do not like that it is often crowded. Also the quality of your drink often depens of a barista skill so 
					 you never know what you will get. There are not a lot of snacks options and they are pricey so I will recommend
					 to take only coffee. But it is a good point that you can find Caffeine everywhere and it is still a pretty
					 popular place among students to study. Hint: to sit in there you even do not have to take an order.
					 Drink recommendation: "Banana drama".

				<h3>10 Tiltu</h3>
				<p>
					 It is a coffee shop in Klaipeda on Turgus bus stop. The signature of this place for me is lamps in the shape circles. It 
					 looks stylish and you can recognise them from the street. This coffee shop is famous for their drinks with whipped cream on
					 top and some cookies. It is plus and minus at the same time. Yes, it is a beatiful picture for your Instagram, but not a lot 
					 of coffee left in the cup after cream. Also for me it is hard to read their menu, but I can give you a lifehack just to photo
					 it and it will be a lot easier. I recommend taking sits near windows and the view is beatiful. But be careful, almost always there
					 are no places, so it is better to go in the mornings.
					 Drink recommendation: "Oreo".

				<h3>Common grounds</h3>
				<p>
					 It is a student coffee shop of LCC International University. Opinians are controversial. Some peopple say it is the most tasty coffee
					 they ever tried, while other claims it is dirt in the cup. My barista friend said that they have professional equipment, but the quality
					 of the coffee beans themselves are not so good. I tried it a couple of time and I could not say whether I like it a lot or not. It is just
					 normal. But usually it takes a lot of time for barists to prepare your drink, so I would recommend to go only in the case you have a lot of
					 free time. From benefits there a interesting seasonal options.
					 Drink recommendation: "Pumpkin spice latte".

				<h3>Perfect morning</h3>
				<p>
					 It is a project of my friend who decided to make coffee for students in dorms. If you are an LCC student it is a wonderful chice 
					 for you as the prices for all drinks are the same and they are extremely cheap. You do not have to leave Newman to get a coffee from
					 a professional barista, as Julia spend all her summer training making coffes in Vilnius. The inly minus it is probably would be hard 
					 to get for those who are not studying at LCC.
					 Drink recommendation: "Latte".

				<h3>Formosa</h3>
				<p>
					 Unexpected place to see it in the coffee section, huh? Formosa is a boba tea chain. But I can say that coffees with tapioka topping
					 are actually a good choice and definately worth of trying. For some people it might see a little too sugary. I could say that this is
					 an option when you are tired of classic coffee drinks. But it is really not for all, as some people do not like boba at all. I tried it
					 in Klaipeda and I could say that I enjoyed it. Also you need to understand that it is not coffee coffee, it is still tea with milk.
					 Drink recommendation: "Taro latte".
