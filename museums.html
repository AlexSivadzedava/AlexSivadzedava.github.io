				<h3>Pilies museum</h3>
				<p>
				Pilies museum is a museum in the center of Klaipeda that tells the history of the city in the interactive way. "Pilies" is translated to English as "castle".
				This museum is built in the place of the old castle, although now it is just a Hill. 
				As I mentioned museum is interactive, all parts are moving, there are a lot of holograms that make the material memorable. 
				When we traveled with the family, my sister called this museum as "how to make something special out of nothing". 
				It is 100% that you will make new photos for your Instagram there. The only trouble is that some of rooms on the restoration and you are not able to get full experience.
				11 March tickets are free as it is Lithuania Independence day!

				<h3>Sea museum</h3>
				<p>
				Sea museum is a little hard to get in, as it is situated on Curonian spit. Firstly you need to take fairy from Klaipeda, then walk 20 minutes to the museum.
				It is worth it as the museum is not only oceanarium, but also delphinarium, museum of ships, and Lithuanian history. You could go inside one of three ships that are displayed before the museum. 
				The ship tells the story of Lithuanian marine under the USSR control.
				You also will see how fisherman lived and even got the opportunity to make sailor's knots. The oceanarium itself is a fort that was build by germans. My favourite part of the museum
				is the tunnel with fish swimming around you. Dissadvantage is that there are always a lot of people and I do not recommend this place to people who are scared of crowds and small spaces.
				I recommend going to the museum on the last sunday of the month as the tickets will be free.

				<h3>Orvidas farmstead</h3>
				<p> Orvidas was a unique sculptor that saved rocks from the USSR. He made this rocks into statues of saints. He is famous for his Marias that are more
				masculine than usual Marias. People said that Orvidas made rocks look as if they were alive. Even when Orvidas was alive a lot of people visit the farm that
				he worked on to see his statues and to pray. Orvidas refused to give his statues to the museums. So after his death his home became the museum itslelf. 
				Everything remained how it was during his lifetime. As many years passed the sculptures look as they a part of nature. I believe that this is what Orvidas truly wanted as 
				he believed that we own nothing we just rent things and after our deaths they return to mother nature. I would recommend wearing jeans as it is really abounded.</p>

				<h3>Rumšiškės</h3>
				<p>It is a cultural museum telling the culture of Lithuanian regions. I have quite a fascinating story connected to this place as the women
				who creates belts from wool let me tried it myself. I was not pacient enough so now I have a bracelet instead of the belt. It is also 
				extremely easy to get lost in a place like this. Me and my friend explored abounded wooden houses in high grass, because we could not 
				find any directinos. From benefits it is atmosphere and extremely delicious traditional Lithuanian food in their cafe. Some houses inside have 
				traditional furniture and it is interesting to explore the village by yourself. On every "region" there is a special guide who is alway ready to help.</p>

				<h3>Hill of Crosses</h3>
				<p>I advise you to go by car/bus as there is no another way. Do not worry about bringing crosses, you can by one on entrance.
				This place is sugnificant as it was demolished two times and always came back. Even if you are not christian this place is still have an impact on you.
				There are crosses that you can only imagine. Many of them are hand-made. I could say for sure that there is a special atmosphere. I would recommend to bring 
				cross with you as you would feel yourself as a part of something bigger. The thing that surprised me the most is that a lot of people acti=ually brought not only crosses, 
				but also flags and national symbols.</p>

				<h3>Cold War museums</h3>
				<p>I do not think that you would be able to visit this place without a car or a tour bus as it is 
				basically loacted almost in forest. Of course it is as it used to be a secret place where the USSR hid their missels.
				Right now it is completely safe and it is the museum of cold war between the USA and the USSR, their propaganda and the 
				symbol of how the Soviet Union prepared and was scared of something that never really happened. I think this museum would
				be interesting to someone who is fond of technologies or do not know much about the Cold War. I expected more rooms about propaganda,
				but it is mostly about missels. Bring some coats as it is really cold there. Advantage is that you can try the gas mask on.</p>
