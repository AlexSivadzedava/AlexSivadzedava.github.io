             You just moved to Lithuania and do not know where to start? Do not worry as I’ve been in the same situation just a year ago.
			 This website is a collection of some places in Lithuania that I find interesting. Nobody had paid me, so only honest opinion. 
			 All the places that are shown are cheap and affordable for students. All of the photos on the website were not shoot by professional, but by me or my friends but on my hone or camera.

			<b>USEFUL ADVICE</b> 
			In Lithuania you do not neccessarily need to know Lthuanian language, but knowing either russian or english would be a huge benefit. Older generation
			mostly speak russian, while younger speak english. But it is always polite to ask which language does the preson speak. So advice from my own experience,
			it is always better to start a conversation with Lithuanian by this phrase "Atsiprašau, ar jus kalbate angliškai arba rusiškai?" It means "Excuse me, do you speak
			english or russian?" Furthermore, there is a stereotype that Lithuanians are rude and serious. It is partially true, but it does not mean that you should not ask them for help. A lot of people would
			really want you to help. But if you do not want to interact with people, then you can buy Pildyk sim card with unlimited internet. It would solve the problem of being shy and lost at the same time. And in 
			order to avoid being shy and lost I think it is a good choice to prepare your trip in advance what you can do with my website.

			  Hello, my sunshines! I'm Alex and almost for a year I live in Klaipeda. It is a port city in Lithuania. Originally I'm from
			  Belarus but I needed to move in order to study. I study Communication at LCC International University. One of my hobbies is dancing,
			  while my another hobbie is to get lost in unknown cities. Yes, this is exactly the way how I explored Lithuania. And in order to make your
			  travel in Lithuania a little bit easier.
